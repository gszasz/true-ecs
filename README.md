# True-ECS

Calculates valid ECS coordinates (RA, DEC) from the image coordinates (X, Y)
using corrected WCS parameters.  This code is handy for the automated ex-post
astrometric corrections of large amounts of photometric measurements.

To determine correct WCS parameters, True-ECS queries Astrometry.net service via
API.  Astrometry.net ignores WCS parameters provided by the FITS header.
Instead, it directly cross-matches a dozen sources in the image using pattern
recognition and then uses these positions to determine the correct WCS
parameters inversely.  Since the method is agnostic to the original WCS
transform parameters, it covers many real-life scenarios that would otherwise be
hard to solve.


## Installation

1. Clone repository and change into the project directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/gszasz/true-ecs.git
cd true-ecs
```

2. Copy the example `config.yaml` into the project directory.

```
cp examples/config.yaml .
```

3. Open the file with your favorite text editor and put there your personal API
key from the Astrometry.net.  Change directory and filenames so they would
reflect your data-file structure.  You can use glob patterns and `{target}`
placeholer that will be replaced by name of the current target.  List all your
targets in the list of targets.

## Usage

Program has no command line options.  All options are defined by by the
`config.yaml` configuration file.

```
./true-ecs.py
```
